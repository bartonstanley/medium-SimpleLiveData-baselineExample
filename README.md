# Simple, working Android LiveData examples - baseline example

This is the baseline example from my Medium article, 
[Simple, working Android LiveData examples](https://medium.com/@bartonstanley/simple-working-android-livedata-examples-93653be5ada6).
It is an app that displays the length of a string and updates the length value as the user edits the string.
The app is not really practical but does achieve the goal of providing a super-simple example of `LiveData` based on the
guidance given in Google's
[Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide).
